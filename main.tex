%Blabla 2 (suite à une pb de synchronisation depuis la version locale)
Dear PhD students,

you now arrived on the campus of the big and prestigious École Centrale de Nantes as a PhD student!
If you are reading this, it means that you're already on the scene \todo{(?)} and you're about to begin.
We do not know yet who you are, where you come from and if what we wrote here is useful.
Maybe you're already familiar with the school and its surroundings?
But many of you know nothing about this school, the life in the laboratory, in Nantes or even life in France for some foreigners.
We wrote this little booklet for these people.
It will introduce you to the practical life in and outside the campus.
What will happen to you? Are you going out? This document is meant to help you quickly.
It was conducted by members of the Association des Étudiants en Doctorat (AED), which is an association dedicated to PhD students on the Ecole Centrale de Nantes campus (which you may join later, why not).
Without necessarily get there, it is a living document, which asks only to be improved. \todo{(?)}
Time that the first question \todo{(???)}, if you have questions this booklet does not answer, do not hesitate to contact us, we will do our best to answer them!

\section*{The AED (Association des Étudiants en Doctorat) (PhD Students Association)}
\begin{quotation}
The thesis takes time, changing its author into a hybrid creature, half-student, half-adult, stuck between two ages.
It also consumes space by stacking books, cards and drafts. It abrades the privacy. It gives headaches.
She is also the heart, \todo{(?)} it creates emotional involvement [\dots] It's also the object of all his troubles
\end{quotation}
\todo{Citation de qui ?}

This is why it is necessary to fight all together, united, compacted against it.
To this end, we have decided to create an association of PhD students on the campus of the École Centrale.
The goals of the association are to:
\begin{itemize}
\item enable doctoral students of different teams, different labs to exchange and gather.
\item organize scientific and cultural events throughout the year (PhD students workshops, karting, pool, tree climbing, parties, \dots)
\item information towards the PhD students of the school
\end{itemize}
Of course, all PhD students are welcome in the association.
