\chapter*{Introduction}
Dear new PhD student,

You are now arrived on the campus of the big and prestigious École Centrale de Nantes as a PhD student (or maybe you are still alone in front of your computer during your internship) !
If you are reading this, it means that you're already in and you're about to begin.
We do not know yet who you are, where you come from and if what we wrote here is useful.
Maybe you're already familiar with the school and its surroundings?
But many of you know nothing about this school, the life in the laborators, in Nantes or even life in France for some foreigners.
We wrote this little booklet for these people.
It will introduce you to the practical life in and outside the campus.
What will happen to you? Are you going out? This document is meant to help you quickly.
It was conducted by members of the Association des Étudiants en Doctorat (AED), which is an association dedicated to PhD students on the Ecole Centrale de Nantes campus (which you may join later, why not).
Without necessarily get there, it is a living document, which asks only to be improved.
Hoping to see you as soon as possible.

\section*{The AED (Association des Étudiants en Doctorat) (PhD Students Association)}
\begin{quotation}
The thesis takes time, changing its author into a hybrid creature, half-student, half-adult, stuck between two ages.
It also consumes space by stacking books, cards and drafts. It abrades the privacy. It gives headaches.
\emph{She} is also the heart,  it creates emotional involvement. It's also the object of all his troubles
\end{quotation}

This is why it is necessary to fight all together, united, compacted against it.
To this end, we have decided to create an association of PhD students on the campus of the École Centrale.


The Association of PhD Students of the École Centrale de Nantes (AED) aims to act on 2 distinct and complementary levels. Firstly, on an academical level, it attempts to provide some useful information to Master and PhD students. Secondly, on a sociocultural level, it allows to create social ties between the current PhD students of the 5 laboratories of the École Centrale de Nantes.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Inform Master and engineering students about PhD and research,
    \item Inform PhD students about their future life as young researchers, and about the École Centrale de Nantes and its organization. For instance, it seems important that all PhD students know that they have representatives at the councils of the school (see below).
    \item Gather together all PhD students for various social or cultural events. These events allow to meet and exchange with other PhD students from the same laboratory or from other laboratories. Several events have already taken place, such as informal seminars or company visits (please refer to the news).
\end{enumerate}

For more information, please do not hesitate to contact the AED. (\url{aed@ec-nantes.fr})


During the year, we organize several very fun activities :
\begin{itemize}
    \item PhD Conferences
    \item Billiard
    \item Karting
    \item \LaTeX{} teaching
    \item BBQ
    \item Visit of companies (Airbus, DCNS, Peugeot-Citroën)
    \item Tree climbing
    \item Pub
\end{itemize}
